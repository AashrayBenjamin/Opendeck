# Opendeck
## Specialisation project using a popular LLM

## How to run the project: -

1. Create a .env file and store your Key.
2. I used PALM API now called Gemini Pro since it also allowed for image as input and was free at the time.
   
## What it does ?

1. First upload a document like a PDF, with the context or even multiple documents this helps us narrow down our search and give a topic or subject to the prompt.
2. Alternatively The ImgSearch page  has option to upload any image or screenshot of a course for example, its the example prompt i made, it will give a description, and some alternative course suggestions.
